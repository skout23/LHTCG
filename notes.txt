What did I learn in the control flow section:
    case switching
    if statements
    for statements
    ascii is just a subset of utf8... kinda 
    utf8 is HUGE
    logic / conditionals 
    breaking/continue in loops
    loops are iterations
    runes are "string literals" <-- need to review this more



callbacks are passing a func as an argument
closure is ... returning a func? 

defer waits until just before enclosing scope/func exits...

Still need to review callbacks, and map
